BazisLib is a library that simplifies development of drivers and applications
for Windows x86/x64 and Windows Mobile. It consists of an object-oriented
framework for creating Windows drivers (including a patched version of STLPort),
a set of common interfaces for kernel- and user-mode services, and a set of
classes for simplifying several user-mode Windows tasks, such as dealing with
files or managing Windows Services. Many open-source projects provided by
SysProgs, such as WinCDEmu, are based on BazisLib.
